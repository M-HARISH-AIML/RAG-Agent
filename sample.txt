Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

Types of AI:
1. Narrow AI – Focused on a single task, like Siri or Google Assistant.
2. General AI – Performs any intellectual task that a human can do.
3. Superintelligent AI – Surpasses human intelligence (still theoretical).

Machine Learning:
Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data. It includes:
- Supervised Learning: Algorithms learn from labeled data.
- Unsupervised Learning: Algorithms find hidden patterns in unlabeled data.
- Reinforcement Learning: Agents learn by interacting with the environment and receiving rewards.

Deep Learning:
A subset of machine learning involving neural networks with many layers. It's used in image recognition, NLP, and more.

Applications of AI:
- Healthcare: Diagnosing diseases using AI-powered imaging.
- Finance: Fraud detection and algorithmic trading.
- Autonomous Vehicles: Self-driving cars rely heavily on AI for perception, planning, and control.

Challenges in AI:
- Bias in data
- Interpretability of models
- Ethical concerns like privacy, job automation, and surveillance.

Conclusion:
AI continues to revolutionize industries, but it must be developed responsibly to ensure fairness, safety, and transparency.
